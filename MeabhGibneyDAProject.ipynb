    "- Some players were missing their country and an alternative empty value was not being recorded affecting the resulting data set.\n",
    "  - The lengths of the table cells the players country and other information was different depending on whether or not country info was present. Using this it was possible to add an empty value for players without a country listed.\n",
    "- The other match information, rated/unrated, online/lan, game version. Did not include anything to represent a rated match, only unrated.\n",
    "  - I assumed all unmarked matches were rated. Again the length of the table cell varied if the unrated symbol was included or not.  "
